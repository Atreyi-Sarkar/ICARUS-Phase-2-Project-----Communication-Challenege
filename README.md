# ICARUS Phase-2 Project --- Communication Challenege
Reliable communication is the lifeline of any CubeSat mission. With limited power, bandwidth, and  hardware resources, small errors in modem design or coding can mean the difference between a  successful downlink and complete data loss.  This challenge simulates those realities through a staged dataset of received signals. Each phase  introduces controlled impairments—timing errors, noise calibration traps, coding requirements, and  Doppler shifts—that mirror conditions encountered in low Earth orbit.  Candidates must design and refine receiver algorithms to recover the original bitstreams and  demonstrate robust performance against defined thresholds. The process is intentionally iterative:  naive solutions will fail, requiring careful analysis, algorithmic insight, and systematic debugging.
